# RedisMutex

This gem provides very simple distributed pessimistic locking using Redis.

It provides no API, at present, for a blocking lock operation. For our purposes, we don't require blocking, as we're using this within a Sidekiq work fetcher, which already has polling semantics (and in which the order of fetchers attempting to lock isn't important).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redis_mutex'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redis_mutex
